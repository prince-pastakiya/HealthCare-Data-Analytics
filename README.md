Key features of the dashboard include:

1. **Interactive Visualizations** for patient admissions, department utilization, and service categories.
2. **Advanced KPIs** such as average length of stay, patient count trends, and occupancy rates.
3. **Segmentation Analysis** based on patient type, department, and admission category.
4. **Operational Reporting Tools** designed for hospital staff and data analysts.
5. **User-Centered Design** for intuitive navigation and actionable storytelling.

🎯 This project demonstrates my capabilities in:
- Healthcare Data Analytics  
- Power BI & Dashboard Design  
- DAX for Advanced Metrics  
- Power Query (ETL)  
- SQL & Data Modeling  
- Data-Driven Decision Support

## 🧬 Dataset Details

**Source**: Simulated healthcare datasets (CSV format)

- **Categories Tracked**:
  - Admission Type: Inpatient, Outpatient, Same-Day
  - Department: Emergency, Surgery, Cardiology, etc.
  - Patient Metrics: Admission Date, Stay Duration, Visit Count
  - Service Utilization: Beds Occupied, Discharges, Average Stay

- **Data Cleaning**:
  - Removed duplicates and nulls  
  - Standardized formats  
  - Built relationships between tables for star schema modeling

## 📈 Key Insights Uncovered

The dashboard helps answer essential hospital questions like:

- What are the most utilized departments and patient types?
- How does **patient volume** vary over time?
- What’s the **average stay duration** per admission type?
- Which **services or departments** are over/under-utilized?
- How can staffing and resources be better aligned with trends?

These insights directly support **hospital administration**, **capacity planning**, and **performance monitoring**.
